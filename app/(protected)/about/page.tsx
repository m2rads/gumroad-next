      <p>
        We want to democratize the ability to sell stuff online. You&#39;re a creative person; you create a lot of content. But most of it, you never sell! It&#39;s either too hard, or too time-consuming, or it doesn&#39;t even make sense to put in a store!
      </p>
      <p>We let you easily sell the stuff you weren&#39;t able to before. It turns out, that includes a lot of stuff.</p>
      <p>
        We&#39;re early in the process of changing the world and all that fun stuff, but we&#39;re <a href="mailto:hi@gumroad.com">always looking for help</a>.
